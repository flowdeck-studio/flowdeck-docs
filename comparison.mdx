## When to Use the CLI

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Terminal Workflow" icon="terminal">
    You prefer working in the terminal and want keyboard-driven development
  </Card>
  <Card title="CI/CD Pipelines" icon="gears">
    You need to automate builds and tests in GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.
  </Card>
  <Card title="AI Assistants" icon="robot">
    You're using Claude Code or other AI coding assistants
  </Card>
  <Card title="Scripting" icon="code">

## Using Both Together

Many developers use both tools:

- **Cursor Extension** for day-to-day development with debugging and code intelligence
- **CLI** for running builds in CI/CD or when working with AI assistants

<Note>
  The Cursor Extension and CLI maintain separate configurations. They do not share state files, so you'll need to configure your workspace, scheme, and simulator selections independently in each tool.
