FlowDeck CLI is available for macOS and can be installed with a single command.

## Prerequisites

Before installing FlowDeck CLI, ensure you have:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Recent macOS running on an Apple Silicon or Intel Mac">
    <Warning>
      Windows and Linux are not supported.
    </Warning>
    - macOS 13 (Ventura) or higher
  </Step>
  <Step title="Xcode">
    <Info>
      FlowDeck uses Xcode's internal tools to build and debug your apps.
    </Info>
    - Download from the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) (16.0 or later)
    - Launch Xcode at least once to install components
    - Accept the license agreement
  </Step>
  <Step title="Xcode Command Line Tools">
    Install the latest command line tools

    ```bash
    xcode-select --install
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Installation

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -sSL https://flowdeck.studio/install.sh | sh
```

The installer will install to `~/.local/bin` by default. If this directory is not in your PATH, it will provide a command to add it.

## Verify Installation

After installation, verify FlowDeck CLI is working:

```bash
flowdeck --version
```

You should see output like:

```
1.2.0 (247)
```

## License Activation

FlowDeck CLI requires a valid license for full functionality. A license is valid for two (2) machines.

### Start a Free Trial

Try FlowDeck free for 7 days with full access to all features. No credit card required.

```bash
flowdeck license trial
```

You'll be prompted to enter your name and email address. After the trial expires, visit [flowdeck.studio/pricing](https://flowdeck.studio/pricing) to purchase a license.

### Activate Your License

```bash
flowdeck license activate YOUR-LICENSE-KEY
```

### Check License Status

```bash
flowdeck license status
```

### CI/CD Usage

<Note>
  Using your license as an environment variable **does not count against your license limit**, but the functionality is restricted to CI/CD environments only (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI, Jenkins, etc.).
</Note>

For CI/CD environments, set the license key as an environment variable instead of activating:

```bash
export FLOWDECK_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR-LICENSE-KEY
flowdeck build --workspace MyApp.xcworkspace --simulator "iPhone 16"
```

## Next Steps

Once installed, try these commands:

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd ~/Projects/MyApp

# Launch interactive mode
flowdeck -i

# Or run commands directly
flowdeck build --workspace MyApp.xcworkspace --scheme myApp --simulator "iPhone 16"
```

<Note>
  Check the [Command Reference](/cli/commands) for complete documentation of all available commands.
</Note>

## Updating

### Via Built-in Update Command

```bash
# Check for updates
flowdeck update --check

# Update to latest version
flowdeck update
```

### Via Installer

You can also re-run the installer to update:

```bash
curl -sSL https://flowdeck.studio/install.sh | sh
```

## Uninstallation

<Warning>
  Before uninstalling, run `flowdeck license deactivate` to free up your license activation slot.
</Warning>

```bash
# Remove the binary and resources
rm -rf ~/.local/share/flowdeck

# Remove the symlink
rm ~/.local/bin/flowdeck

# Remove configuration files
rm -rf ~/.flowdeck
