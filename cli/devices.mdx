FlowDeck CLI supports deploying and running your apps on physical Apple devices connected to your Mac.

## Listing Devices

### List All Connected Devices

```bash
flowdeck device list
```

### Filter by Platform

```bash
flowdeck device list --platform iOS
```

### Show Only Available Devices

```bash
flowdeck device list --available-only
```

### JSON Output

```bash
flowdeck device list --json
```

**Example output:**

```
iOS Devices:
--------------------------------------------------
  🔌 [✓] Daniel's iPhone
     OS: iOS 17.2 | Type: iPhone
     UDID: 00008110-000123456789ABCD
     Connection: USB

Found 1 device(s)
```

**Legend:**
- 🔌 = USB connection
- 📡 = Network connection
- [✓] = Available

## Selecting a Device

Interactively select a device for your project:

```bash
flowdeck device select
```

This saves the selection to `.flowdeck/state.json` for use with other commands.

## Installing Apps

### Install an App

```bash
flowdeck device install <UDID> /path/to/MyApp.app
```

### Uninstall an App

```bash
flowdeck device uninstall <UDID> com.example.MyApp
```

## Launching Apps

Launch an installed app on a device:

```bash
flowdeck device launch <UDID> com.example.MyApp
```

## Device Requirements

Before deploying to a physical device, ensure:

- Device is connected via USB or USB-C
- Device is trusted and unlocked
- Apple Developer account has correct provisioning profiles
- Device is registered in your Apple Developer account
- App's bundle identifier matches your provisioning profile
- Deployment target is compatible with device's iOS version

## Connection Types

FlowDeck automatically detects:

- **USB** - Direct wired connection (most reliable)
- **Network** - WiFi network debugging (iOS 14+)

<Note>
  Network debugging requires the device to be on the same WiFi network and previously paired via USB.
</Note>

## Debugging Method Selection

FlowDeck automatically selects the best debugging method:

- **iOS 17+** - Uses `devicectl` for faster, more reliable debugging
- **iOS 16 and below** - Uses `ios-deploy` for compatibility

## Troubleshooting

### Device Not Appearing

1. Ensure the device is unlocked and trusted
2. Try unplugging and reconnecting the USB cable
3. Refresh the device list:

```bash
flowdeck device list
```

### Code Signing Issues

Check your provisioning profiles and certificates in Xcode's Preferences > Accounts.

### Connection Problems

- Try a different USB cable
- Check that the device trusts your Mac
- For network debugging, ensure both are on the same WiFi network
