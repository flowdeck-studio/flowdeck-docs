## Config File

Many commands support loading settings from a JSON config file via `--config`:

```json
{
  "workspace": "MyApp.xcworkspace",
  "scheme": "MyApp",
  "configuration": "Debug",
  "platform": "iOS",
  "version": "18.0",
  "derivedDataPath": "/custom/path"
}
```

This is useful for saving project configuration once and reusing it across commands.
