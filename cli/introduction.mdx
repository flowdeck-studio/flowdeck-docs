FlowDeck CLI is a standalone command-line tool for building, running, and testing iOS/macOS applications without leaving your terminal. It provides a streamlined development experience for developers who prefer working from the command line or need to integrate Xcode builds into CI/CD pipelines.

## Why FlowDeck CLI?

## Key Features

- **Build & Run** - Compile and launch iOS/macOS apps on simulators or devices
- **Test Execution** - Run unit and UI tests with detailed results
- **Simulator Management** - Boot, shutdown, and manage iOS simulators
- **Device Support** - Deploy and run on physical Apple devices
- **Log Streaming** - Real-time OSLog streaming from running apps
- **JSON Output** - Machine-readable output for automation and AI agents
- **Project Discovery** - Auto-detect workspaces, schemes, and build configurations

## Requirements

<Warning>
  FlowDeck CLI requires macOS with Xcode installed. It does not support Windows or Linux.
</Warning>

- **macOS** 13.0 or later
- **Xcode** 15.0 or later (with command line tools)
- **Apple Silicon Mac**: M1 or later recommended for best performance

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install FlowDeck CLI
curl -sSL https://flowdeck.studio/install.sh | sh

# CD to your macOS or iOS project
cd ~/myApp

# Start FlowDeck's interactive mode
flowdeck -i
```

For interactive development with a GUI-like experience, see [Interactive Mode](/cli/interactive).

### Static CLI Usage (Recommended for Agents)

For AI agents and CI/CD, use the `init` workflow to save project settings:

```bash
# 1. Discover project structure
flowdeck context --json

# 2. Initialize with discovered settings
flowdeck init -w MyApp.xcworkspace -s MyApp -S "iPhone 16"

# 3. Run commands without parameters
flowdeck build    # Uses saved settings
flowdeck run      # Uses saved settings
flowdeck test     # Uses saved settings
flowdeck clean    # Uses saved settings
```

<Tip>
After running `flowdeck init`, all subsequent commands use the saved settings automatically. This is the recommended approach for AI agents and CI/CD pipelines.
