FlowDeck CLI can stream real-time OSLog output from your running apps, making it easy to monitor app behavior without switching to Console.app.

## Streaming Logs

### Run with Log Streaming

The easiest way to stream logs is to use the `--log` flag when running:

```bash
flowdeck run --workspace MyApp.xcworkspace --simulator "iPhone 16" --log
```

This builds, runs, and immediately starts streaming logs from your app.

### Stream Logs from Running App

If your app is already running, use the `apps` and `logs` commands:

```bash
# List running apps
flowdeck apps

# Stream logs from an app
flowdeck logs <app-id>
```

**Example:**

```bash
$ flowdeck apps
Running Apps:
  abc123  com.example.MyApp  iPhone 16 Pro
  def456  com.example.Test   iPad Pro

Use 'flowdeck logs <app-id>' to stream logs
Use 'flowdeck stop <app-id>' to stop an app

$ flowdeck logs abc123
```

## Using OSLog in Your Code

FlowDeck captures logs from Apple's unified logging system (OSLog):

```swift
import os

// Create a logger
let logger = Logger(subsystem: "com.example.myapp", category: "networking")

// Log at different levels
logger.debug("Debug: Starting request")
logger.info("Info: Request completed")
logger.warning("Warning: Slow response detected")
logger.error("Error: Request failed")
```

### Log Levels

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `debug` | Detailed debugging information |
| `info` | General informational messages |
| `warning` | Warning conditions |
| `error` | Error conditions |
| `fault` | Critical errors |

## Log Output

Logs are displayed with color-coded output based on log level:

```
[DEBUG] 10:23:45.123 - Starting network request
[INFO]  10:23:45.234 - User logged in successfully
[WARN]  10:23:45.345 - API response slow (>2s)
[ERROR] 10:23:45.456 - Failed to parse JSON response
```

## Stopping Log Streaming

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop streaming logs.

## Stopping Running Apps

Stop an app that was launched by FlowDeck:

```bash
flowdeck stop <app-id>
```

## Limitations

<Warning>
  Log streaming is currently only available for simulators. For physical devices, use Console.app on macOS.
</Warning>

### Simulator Only

Due to Apple platform restrictions, FlowDeck can only stream logs from:
- iOS Simulators
- macOS apps (when running directly)

### For Physical Devices

Use macOS Console.app:
1. Open Console.app
2. Select your device from the sidebar
3. Filter by your app's process name or bundle identifier

## Tips

<Tip>
  Use specific subsystem and category names in your OSLog calls to make filtering easier:

  ```swift
  let logger = Logger(subsystem: "com.example.myapp", category: "auth")
  ```
</Tip>

<Note>
  Debug-level logs may not appear in Release builds. Use Info level or higher for logs you always want to see.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

### No Logs Appearing

1. Ensure your app uses `os.log` or `Logger` APIs (not just `print()`)
2. Verify the app is running on a simulator
3. Check that the debug session started successfully

### Too Many Logs

FlowDeck automatically filters to your app's process. If you're still seeing too many logs:
- Use more specific subsystem/category names
- Reduce debug-level logging in your code

### Logs Not Updating

If logs stop appearing:
1. Check that the app is still running: `flowdeck apps`
2. Restart log streaming: `flowdeck logs <app-id>`
