description: "Add FlowDeck as a project skill for Codex"
---

Codex can load project-specific skills from your repo. Add the FlowDeck skill to your Codex skills folder.

## What the Skill Does

The FlowDeck skill teaches the agent to use FlowDeck for iOS/macOS build, run, test, and debug workflows instead of Apple CLI tools. It also standardizes project discovery and simulator management so the agent can operate with fewer retries.

<Note>
  Skills provide guidance, but they do not prevent the agent from sidetracking to xcodebuild or simctl.
</Note>

## Reinforce in AGENTS.md

Codex does not support hooks to prevent it from using Apple tools, so for better performance, it's recommended to include the following in your AGENTS.md file to instruct it to prefer the FlowDeck skill:

```text
Use the FlowDeck skill and CLI for all iOS/macOS build, run, test, and debug tasks.
Do not use xcodebuild, xcrun simctl, or other Apple CLI tools unless FlowDeck is unavailable.
If a FlowDeck command fails, troubleshoot using FlowDeck output and retry before falling back.
```

## Project vs System Skill

### Project Skill (Shared with the Repo)

```bash
mkdir -p .codex/skills/flowdeck
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flowdeck-studio/flowdeck-plugin/main/skills/flowdeck/SKILL.md -o .codex/skills/flowdeck/SKILL.md
```

### System Skill (Applies to All Projects)

Codex supports system skills. To install a skill system-wide, use the built-in `$skill-installer` from within Codex and restart after install.

```text
$skill-installer install https://github.com/flowdeck-studio/flowdeck-plugin/tree/main/skills/flowdeck
```

## Example Prompts

```text
"Build and run my app on an iPhone 16 simulator"
"Run the unit tests and fix any failures"
"Take a screenshot of the current simulator state"
"Run the app and check logs to understand why the login screen isn't working"
```
