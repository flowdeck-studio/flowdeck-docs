description: "Use FlowDeck in Claude Code with the plugin (preferred) or a skill-only setup"
---

FlowDeck provides an official Claude Code plugin (preferred because it enforces FlowDeck usage and blocks Apple CLI tools). If you can't use plugins, you can add the FlowDeck skill directly.

## Option 1 (Preferred): Install the Plugin

```bash
/plugin marketplace add flowdeck-studio/flowdeck-plugin
/plugin install flowdeck@flowdeck-plugins/flowdeck
```

Restart Claude Code after installing the plugin.

## What It Does

Once installed, Claude Code will automatically:

1. Use `flowdeck` commands instead of xcodebuild, xcrun simctl, etc.
2. Follow the FlowDeck debug loop (run app, attach logs, capture screenshots)
3. Block attempts to use Apple CLI tools directly

## What the Skill Does

If you add the FlowDeck skill instead of the plugin, it teaches the agent to use FlowDeck for iOS/macOS build, run, test, and debug workflows instead of Apple CLI tools. It also standardizes project discovery and simulator management so the agent can operate with fewer retries.

<Note>
  The skill does not prevent the agent from sidetracking to xcodebuild or simctl. The plugin enforces that behavior.
</Note>

## Option 2: Add the Skill (No Plugin)

### Project Skill (Recommended for Teams)

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills/flowdeck
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flowdeck-studio/flowdeck-plugin/main/skills/flowdeck/SKILL.md -o .claude/skills/flowdeck/SKILL.md
```

### System Skill (Applies to All Projects)

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/flowdeck
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flowdeck-studio/flowdeck-plugin/main/skills/flowdeck/SKILL.md -o ~/.claude/skills/flowdeck/SKILL.md
```

## Recommended Workflow

AI agents should use the `context` -> `init` workflow for reliable builds:

```bash
# 1. Discover project structure
flowdeck context --json

# 2. Initialize with discovered settings
flowdeck init -w MyApp.xcworkspace -s MyApp -S "iPhone 16"

# 3. Run commands without parameters
flowdeck build   # Uses saved settings
flowdeck run     # Uses saved settings
flowdeck test    # Uses saved settings
```

## Example Prompts

Just ask Claude Code to work with your iOS/macOS project:

```text
"Build and run my app on an iPhone 16 simulator"
"Run the unit tests and fix any failures"
"Take a screenshot of the current simulator state"
"Run the app and check logs to understand why the login screen isn't working"
```

## Uninstall

```bash
/plugin uninstall flowdeck
```
