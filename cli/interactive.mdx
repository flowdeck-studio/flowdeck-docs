FlowDeck CLI includes a powerful interactive mode that provides a terminal-based IDE experience. Launch it with `flowdeck -i` to get a persistent development environment with keyboard shortcuts, log streaming, and a status bar.

## Launching Interactive Mode

```bash
cd ~/Projects/MyApp
flowdeck -i
```

On first run, the interactive mode will guide you through a setup assistant to configure your workspace, scheme, and target.

## Status Bar

The bottom of the terminal displays a persistent status bar showing:

- **Project name** and git branch
- **Current scheme**
- **Target** (simulator or device)
- **Build configuration** (Debug/Release)
- **App status** (Idle, Building, Running, Error)

## Features

### Log Streaming

Press `L` to toggle real-time OSLog streaming from your running app. Logs appear in the main output area while the status bar remains fixed at the bottom.

### Test Selection

When you press `U` to run tests, you can choose:

- **All Tests** - Run the complete test suite for the selected Scheme
- **Recent Tests** - Re-run tests from your current session
- **Specific Tests** - Pick individual test classes or methods

### Scheme & Target Selection

Press `S` or `T` to interactively select from available schemes, simulators, or connected devices. Your selection is saved for future sessions.

### AI Agent Integration

Press `G` to access the AI agent integration menu, which helps configure FlowDeck for use with Claude Code and other AI assistants.

## State Persistence

Interactive mode saves your configuration to `.flowdeck/state.json`:

- Workspace path
- Selected scheme
- Selected simulator/device
- Build configuration
- Log streaming preference
- Recent tests

This state persists across sessions, so you can quit and resume without reconfiguring.

## Tips

<Tip>
  Use `ESC` during a build or test run to cancel the operation.
</Tip>

<Note>
  Use 'W' to save your current configuration and use it directly via the standard CLI --config
</Note>

## Exiting

Press `Q` (when no command is running) to exit interactive mode. Your terminal will be restored to its normal state.

## Getting Help

### In Interactive Mode

Press `H` or `?` at any time to display the help screen with all available commands and shortcuts.

### Command Line Help

```bash
# Show all CLI options
flowdeck --help
```

### Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Setup assistant keeps appearing">
    The setup assistant runs when FlowDeck can't find a valid workspace or scheme. Make sure your project has a `.xcworkspace` or `.xcodeproj` file and run the setup again with `S` to select a scheme.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Keyboard shortcuts not working">
    Make sure the terminal window is focused and no command is currently running. Some shortcuts are disabled during builds or test runs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Logs not appearing">
    Press `L` to enable log streaming. Logs only appear when an app is running on a simulator. Physical device logs require Console.app.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Build fails with signing errors">
    Run `flowdeck build` outside interactive mode to see full error output, or check your Xcode signing settings.
  </Accordion>
