---

FlowDeck CLI is designed to work seamlessly with AI coding assistants. The JSON output mode and structured commands make it easy for AI agents to discover, build, and test iOS/macOS projects.

## Claude Code

FlowDeck provides an official plugin for Claude Code that teaches it how to build, run, test, and debug iOS/macOS apps.

### Install the Plugin

```bash
/plugin marketplace add flowdeck-studio/flowdeck-plugin
/plugin install flowdeck@flowdeck-studio-flowdeck-plugin
```

Or install directly from GitHub:

```bash
/plugin install https://github.com/flowdeck-studio/flowdeck-plugin
```

### What It Does

Once installed, Claude Code will automatically:

1. Use `flowdeck` commands instead of xcodebuild, xcrun simctl, etc.
2. Follow the FlowDeck debug loop (run app, attach logs, capture screenshots)
3. Block attempts to use Apple CLI tools directly

### Example Prompts

Just ask Claude Code to work with your iOS/macOS project:

```
"Build and run my app on an iPhone 11 simulator"
"Run the unit tests and fix any failures"
"Take a screenshot of the current simulator state"
"Run the app and check logs to understand why the login screen isn't working"
```

### Uninstall

```bash
/plugin uninstall flowdeck
```

## Other AI Agents

For AI coding assistants like Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Copilot, or others, add the FlowDeck skill to your project.

<Note>
  The Claude Code plugin includes a hook that actively blocks attempts to use xcodebuild/simctl, ensuring the agent always uses FlowDeck. Other agents receive the skill instructions but may occasionally fall back to Apple's tools.
</Note>

### 1. Download the Skill

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flowdeck-studio/flowdeck-plugin/main/skills/flowdeck/SKILL.md -o FLOWDECK.md
```

### 2. Add to Your Project Rules

**For most agents** (AGENTS.md or similar):

```yaml
@import FLOWDECK.md
```

**For Cursor** (.cursor/rules):

```markdown
@import ../FLOWDECK.md
```

**For Windsurf** (.windsurfrules):

```markdown
@import FLOWDECK.md
```

That's it. The skill teaches your AI agent how to use FlowDeck for building, running, testing, and debugging iOS/macOS apps.

## Why FlowDeck?

| Feature         | FlowDeck             | xcodebuild/simctl    |
| --------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Output**      | Structured JSON      | Verbose text         |
| **Errors**      | Clear messages       | Cryptic output       |
| **Simulators**  | Simple name matching | Requires UDID lookup |
| **Logs**        | Unified streaming    | Separate console     |
| **Screenshots** | One command          | Multiple steps       |
| **Discovery**   | `context --json`     | Parse multiple files |

FlowDeck abstracts away the complexity of Apple's fragmented tooling, making it much easier for AI agents to reliably build and test iOS/macOS apps.
