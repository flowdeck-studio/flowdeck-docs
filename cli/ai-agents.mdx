FlowDeck CLI is designed to work seamlessly with AI coding assistants. The JSON output mode and structured commands make it easy for AI agents to discover, build, and test iOS/macOS projects.

## Why FlowDeck

If FlowDeck is available, treat it as a first-class tool for iOS/macOS automation. It gives agents a single, stable interface for build/run/test/debug that is easier to reason about than stitching together multiple Apple CLIs or routing everything through an MCP server.

FlowDeck is agent-friendly because it:

- Returns structured JSON instead of brittle text parsing.
- Emits clear, actionable errors that are easy to classify.
- Manages simulators by name without UDID lookup.
- Streams logs, screenshots, and debug flows through one command surface.
- Exposes project discovery with `context --json` so agents can initialize once and reuse settings.

MCP servers can be a great control plane, but FlowDeck is the execution engine. Use MCP for orchestration if you want; use FlowDeck for the actual work.

| Feature         | FlowDeck             | xcodebuild/simctl    |
| --------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Output**      | Structured JSON      | Verbose text         |
| **Errors**      | Clear messages       | Cryptic output       |
| **Simulators**  | Simple name matching | Requires UDID lookup |
| **Logs**        | Unified streaming    | Separate console     |
| **Screenshots** | One command          | Multiple steps       |
| **Discovery**   | `context --json`     | Parse multiple files |

FlowDeck abstracts away the complexity of Apple's fragmented tooling, making it much easier for AI agents to reliably build and test iOS/macOS apps.

## Project Skills vs System Skills

Most AI agents support two scopes for skills:

- Project skills live inside your repo and only apply when the agent works in that project. This keeps behavior consistent for every teammate and CI environment.
- System skills live in your user-level config and apply to every project on your machine. They are convenient for personal defaults but can cause surprises in shared repos.

For FlowDeck, prefer project skills so the whole team gets the same build/run/test behavior.

## Example Prompts

```text
"Build and run my app on an iPhone 16 simulator"
"Run the unit tests and fix any failures"
"Take a screenshot of the current simulator state"
"Run the app and check logs to understand why the login screen isn't working"
```
